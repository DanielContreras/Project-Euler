# Project Euler Solutions

A collection of solutions to a few [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems. This list will continue to grow over time, as I solve more. The solutions will primarily be done with `Python`. But you can see what solutions have been implented in which language in the table below.

# Contributing with your solutions

## Formatting

### Directory Structure and file naming

Solution files must be called `solution` with the appropriate extension and must be under `[Programming Language]/problem_[problem number]/`

### Commit messages

The commit message for solution files must follow the following structure:  

    `Add [Language] solution for problem [problem number]`

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository  
    `git clone https://github.com/DanielContreras/Project-Euler`
2. Create your solution branch  
    `git checkout -b username/add-[language]-solution-problem-[problem number]`
3. Commit your changes with the following message format
    `Add [language] solution problem [problem number]`
3. Submit your changes for review by clicking `Compare & pull request` on your repository.
